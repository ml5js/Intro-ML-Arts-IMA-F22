# What are data?

## Data Collection

### Objectives:

- Review the full story of building a ML model for classification or regression.
- Understand how data is formatted and downloaded including CSV and JSON.
- Review the terminology of the training process
  - Training
  - Learning Rate
  - Epochs
  - Batch size
  - Loss
- Consider how to frame the problem and collect data.
  - Understand critical questions to ask (e.g. Who is this for? Whatâ€™s the context?)
  - Understand the questions to ask about sourcing and collecting data.
  - Learn how to prepare a data set, including how to normalize and properly format it.

### Tutorials

- Tabular Data (CSV)
  - [Tabular Data](https://youtu.be/RfMkdvN-23o) from Coding Train "Data + APIs" tutorial (lots of extra stuff here the first few minutes is probably most relevant?)
  - [Tabular Data](https://youtu.be/woaR-CJEwqc) Coding Train Processing tutorial (code is not JS!)
  - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/brendan45774/test-file, https://github.com/ml5js/ml5-library/blob/main/examples/p5js/NeuralNetwork/NeuralNetwork_titanic/data/titanic_cleaned.csv
- JSON Data
  - [What is JSON Part 1](https://youtu.be/_NFkzw6oFtQ) - Coding Train p5.js tutorial
  - [What is JSON Part 2](https://youtu.be/118sDpLOClw) - Coding Train p5.js tutorial
  - [JSON Data](https://youtu.be/uxf0--uiX0I) from Coding Train "Data + APIs" tutorial (same as above, lots of extra unrelated stuff here).

### Color Classifier

- [Full Coding Train Video Series using TensorFlow.js](https://youtu.be/y59-frfKR58?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6bmMRCIoTi72aNWHo7epX4L), 7.1-7.5 cover how the data was collected and cleaned

- Data Research Questions
  - Who collected and compiled it?
  - Why was it collected?
  - How was it collected?
  - Describe the data: What are the dimensions? What are the variables and their data types?
  - Is there missing, incorrect, or otherwise problematic data?
  - For whom is this data accurate or useful? What is this data _unrepresentative_ of? (Who is missing and left out of the data?)
  - Knowing what you know now about machine learning, what will a model trained on this data help you do? Are there are alternative (non-machine learning) uses of this data?

## Assignment 5b

For this assignment it's up to you to select an exercise building off of the multiple data collection and model training scenarios we've examined in weeks 4-6. Here are three scenarios to choose from to help you get started. (To be clear, just pick one or combine into one assignment, do not do all three!)

### 1: Interactive Real-Time Gesture Data

Continue working on your sketch from [Assignment 4](https://github.com/ml5js/Intro-ML-Arts-IMA-F22/wiki/Assignment-4). What are your next steps? Maybe try breaking it into multiple sketches for saving / loading the trained model? Or try a regression model instead of classification?

### 2: Working with Quick Draw, DoodleNet

Build off of one of the code examples (or invent your own) to develop you own creative use of Quick, Draw data.

- [Classifying Drawings with ml5's DoodleNet: output in DOM element](https://editor.p5js.org/ima_ml/sketches/IbXlN6voN) -- _Can you make this one work with webcam input instead of canvas?_
- [Classifying Drawings with ml5's DoodleNet: output in separate canvas](https://editor.p5js.org/ima_ml/sketches/XIZEoKBTL)
- Can you try your own doodleNet with a fewer classes? [demo](https://yining1023.github.io/machine-learning-for-the-web/cnn/TrainDoodleClassifier), [code](https://github.com/yining1023/machine-learning-for-the-web/tree/master/cnn/TrainDoodleClassifier), [get doodleNet dataset](https://github.com/googlecreativelab/quickdraw-dataset#get-the-data), [download](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/quickdraw_dataset/full/numpy_bitmap;tab=objects?prefix=&forceOnObjectsSortingFiltering=false) .npy files.

### 3: Other Data Sources

Try loading JSON or tabular data into a p5.js sketch and train a model. Some suggestions:

- Augment Lydia Jessup's [311 Calls ml5.js example](https://editor.p5js.org/lydiajessup/sketches/NQ6iRoAM2). You could add an additional input field, customize the interface, or change other parameters of `ml5.neuralNetwork()`.
- Train a machine learning model in ml5.js with the dataset you picked for part 1 of the assignment.
