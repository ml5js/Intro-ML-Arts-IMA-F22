### Background: Perceptron and Artifical Neural Networks

- [What is a Neural Network?](https://youtu.be/aircAruvnKk?list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi) by 3Blue1Brown
- Invented in 1957 by Frank Rosenblatt at the Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory ([original paper](http://www.ling.upenn.edu/courses/cogs501/Rosenblatt1958.pdf)), a perceptron is the simplest neural network possible: a computational model of a single neuron. A perceptron consists of one or more inputs, a processor, and a single output. ([More to this history](https://github.com/ml5js/Intro-ML-Arts-IMA-F22/wiki/Brief-History-of-Artificial-Neural-Networks)
- [NOC Neural Network videos](https://youtu.be/XJ7HLz9VYz0?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6aCibgK1PTWWu9by6XFdCfh) - 10.1 to 10.3 cover the "Perceptron", a model of a single neuron. The Perceptron forms the basis of modern multi-layer deep learning networks.

### Assignment 4

1. Watch [Machine Learning for Human Creative Practice](https://vimeo.com/287094397), Dr. Rebecca Fiebrink at Eyeo 2018. Write a response to the following question posed by Dr. Fiebrink:
   - How can machine learning support people's existing creative practices? Expand people's creative capabilities?
2. Dream up and design the inputs and outputs of a real-time machine learning system for interaction and audio/visual performance. This could be an idea well beyond the scope of what you can do in a weekly exercise.
3. Create your own p5+ml5 sketch that trains a model with real-time interactive data. This can be a prototype of the aforementioned idea or a simple exercise where you run this week's code examples with your own data. Here are some exercise suggestions:
   - Try to invent more elegant and intuitive interaction for collecting real-time data beyond clicking buttons?
   - What other real-time inputs might you consider beyond mouse position, image pixels, or face/pose/hand tracking? Could you use real-time sensor data?
   - What other real-time outputs might you consider beyond color or sound modulation? Could the output be a physical computing device? Multiple outputs like R,G,B values?
   - Improve the [handPose example we built in class](https://editor.p5js.org/ima_ml/sketches/JjnhklcOX) https://editor.p5js.org/yining/sketches/dX-aN-8E7
     - Can you add more keypoints from the hand to the data collection? (All the keypoints?)
     - Can you add more classification categories?
     - Can you create an interface for training and showing the results of model's prediction?
     - Can you turn this into a regression model?
4. Complete a blog post with your response, real-time ML system, and documentation of your code exercise and [link from the homework wiki](https://github.com/ml5js/Intro-ML-Arts-IMA-F22/wiki/Assignment-4).
