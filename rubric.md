| **3**   | **Outstanding**: The assignment has a highly creative concept and above and beyond documentation. |

## Criteria (aka “how to get a 3”)

### Project Documentation
* Is the **full story of the project** described including ideas, triumphs and failures? (It’s ok if the project doesn’t work or if you struggled, just tell the story!)
* Are **sources of inspiration and code examples** cited?
* Are **classmates and others who helped** you referenced?
* Is there **comprehensive visual documentation** (not just of the final result, but of the steps along the way)?
* Does it include **thoughts on next steps**?

### Code
* Does the code demonstrate an **understanding of the course material**?
* **Are code sources credited** clearly in the comments?
* **Did the student go beyond the examples provided** by incorporating their own ideas or additional programming concepts not covered in class?
* Is it **legible or human readable**? Are things named appropriately?
* Is it **commented**? If the student were to look at the code in a month, would they be able to know what they did and why?
* Does the code leverage any **patterns** or **approaches** that are noteworthy?

### Reading Responses
* Are **new questions** asked?
* Is there a **point of view** / argument made?
* Are **additional sources and references** mentioned?
* Is the post funny, novel, or otherwise unique?
